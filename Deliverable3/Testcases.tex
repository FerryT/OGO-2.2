	\section{0 Pieces}
    Input: each player has 0 pieces.\\
    Output: error, each player has to begin with at least 1 piece.

	\section{Fox eats dolphin in water}
    Input: a fox is 2 tiles away from the land and there is a dolphin between the fox and the land. The fox moves towards the land and onto the tile that is occupied by the dolphin.\\
    Output: despite of being in the water, the fox will still eat the dolphin.\\
    
    \section{Fox eats dolphin at bridge}
    Input: a bridge has been flooded, and while it was flooded a dolphin swam to one end of it, but the tide lowered and the dolphin can't move anymore. A fox goes up to the bridge from the other side.\\
    Output: because the fox will go to the same tile as the dolphin is currently, the fox will eat the dolphin.\\
    
    \section{Fox wants to go into the water}
    Input: a fox is currently on the land but wants to go into the water.\\
    Output: because the fox $\leq$ 2 tiles away from land it can still move and thus go into the water.\\
    
    \section{A player has won}
    Input: player 1 has eliminated the last animal of player 2.\\
    Output: player 1 has won and the game ends.\\

    Note: because we want to keep it a fair game, all testcases for foxes are also valid for the dolphin in the other way around.\\
