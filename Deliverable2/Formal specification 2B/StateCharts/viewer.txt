After being initialized the viewer comes in the NOP state, which means that it isn't doing anything, but it checks the board for changes via the Controller.requestBoardStatus() function every now and then. If the board has been changed the function updateView() is called to make the changes visible, it also sends out a notifyStateChange() to let the other classes know the state has changed. The viewer is removed when the game is over, but it can also decide to remove itself.
