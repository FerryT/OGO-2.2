First the board is initialized, then the board has to initialize the controller. After that the board goes to the NOP state from which It can answer requests from robots to move, it can also notify robots if they receive a hint, win the game or get moved by the board. After every time the board has done anything it returns to the NOP state, except when a robot has reached itâ€™s hometile, then the board has to terminate other classes via the reset() function. After the game is over the board can either terminate or go back to the initialized state to start a new game.
