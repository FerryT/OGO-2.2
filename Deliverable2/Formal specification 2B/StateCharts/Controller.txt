The controller is the class that manages all communication between all the other classes.
This class also can't do anything without being initialized, so the first thing it does
is initialize. It passes all the messages between the board and the robots. It can also 
call the function switchtiles which selects 2 random tiles and, if there aren't any home- 
and hinttiles, switches them around.
