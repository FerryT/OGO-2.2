The robot class gets initialized by the controller, it starts at a randomly picked spot, which can be a normal tile, a hint tile or a conveyer tile. The robot receives a notifyAutomovement() every time it gets moved, this can happen in 2 ways: the robot steps on a conveyer belt or the robot gets moved via a tileswitch. Whenever a robot is on a tile It can request a move which can result in 3 ways: success, failed or win. If a move request is a success, the move is made, if a move request is a failure, the move is not made because the desired path of the moved Is blocked, if a move request results in a win it means that the robot has reached its hometile the game ends and this robot has won. When another robot wins this robot gets a terminate request from the controller and the game is over. The robot can also encounter hint tiles which point the robot to the location of its hometile.
