The first thing the robot class has to do is initialize, after that it arrives in the NOP
state, from there a lot of things can happen. The first thing that can happen is that the
controllor notifies the robot that an other has won, then this robot has to terminate 
because the game is over. The the controller can also notify this robot that it has been
moved, this is possible because the controller can randomly exchange 2 tiles, and if a 
robot is on one of those tiles it is exchanged allong with the tile, to notify the robot 
of this event, the notifyAutoMovement() function is used. The other 2 things a robot can
do is request move and request turn, both can be declined or allowed by the controller. If
a turn is allowed the robot simply executes the turn. If a move is allowed it is also
executed, but the robot can encounter a conveyer belt, in this case the robot is moved to
a new position and notified of this with teh notifyAutoMovement() function. If the robot 
encounters a hint tile it receives a hint, if the robot encounters it's hometile it has
won and calls terminate(). If a robot hasn't encountered it's hometile it returns to the
NOP state and begins all over again.
