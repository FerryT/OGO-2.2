First the robot requests a move, this request goes to the controller, which passes it on to the board, which retrieves the set possible moves and the set of possible rotations from the rule class. After that the board calls its internal function canPlaceRobot() and checks if the robot can actually make the requested move. After that there are 5 possible MSC’s that can follow after this one.
