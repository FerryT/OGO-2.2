In this section we show the message sequence chart for every possible scenario in our game. Below every chart there is a high-level MSC in which the current state is shown and all possible next states are visible. We begin with initializing the classes, then the robot can request a move, from that point there are  multiple possibilities: the move can be rejected or allowed. If a move is allowed there are 4 options return normal tile, return hint tile, return conveyer tile and return home tile. After that the game goes to its exchange state, except for the return home tile MSC, after that the game will end. We have 2 types of exchange states, ordinary and special, in the ordinary exchange 2 tiles are exchanged, but in the special exchange a robot one or two robots are moved and have to be notified of this.
