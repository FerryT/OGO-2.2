First of all the board is initialized, then the board sends a preInitialize to the controller, when the controller is done with that, board initializes all the robots,  which all reply when done. When all robots have been initialized the board sends a postInitialize to the controller, when then the controller notifies the board it is done with initializing and initializes the viewer. Now all classes have been initialized and the robots can start making move requests.
