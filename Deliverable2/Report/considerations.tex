During the specification of this program, the following decisions have been made:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every robot must be able to reach it's hometile: broken robots and conveyer tile cannot block the path.\\
    \item If a robot tries to lock himself in, the move is denied because it must be able to reach it's hometile.\\
    \item Robots can also be moved by a tileExchange.\\
    \item When a robot is on a conveyer tile and the end of the tile is blocked by another robot, the robot stays on the conveyer tile.\\
    \item If a robot is being moved by a conveyer tile, the movement is not passed to the viewer, only the end tile is passed on.\\
    \item If a robot that can go forward 3 steps at once walks over its hometile, it has won.\\
    \item The viewer receives all the updates from other classes, it doesn't need to make requests.\\
    \item A robot is notified once it has been moved, but it does not know what direction the movement had.\\
\end{itemize}
