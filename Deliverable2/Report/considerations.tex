During the specification of this program, the following decisions have been made:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every robot must be able to reach its hometile: broken robots and conveyer tile cannot block the path.\\
    \item If a robot tries to lock himself in, the move is denied because it must be able to reach it's hometile.\\
    \item Robots can also be moved by a tiles exchange.\\
    \item When a robot is on a conveyer tile and the end of the tile is blocked by another robot, the robot stays on the conveyer tile.\\
    \item If a robot is being moved by a conveyer tile, the robot is moved to the end of the conveyor belt at once; hence, the Viewer will not show the movement of the robot on the belt as separate steps. \\
    \item If a robot that can go do multiple steps at once and it walks over its home tile, it has won.\\
    \item The viewer receives all the updates from other classes, it does not make requests itself.\\
    \item A robot is notified once it has been moved, but it does not know what direction the movement had.\\
\end{itemize}
