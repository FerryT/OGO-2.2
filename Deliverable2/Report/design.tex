\subsection{Class diagram}
	The following graphic is the class diagram that we will use for the specification and the implementation.

\subsection{Class description}
Abstract classes are indicated by guillemets and enumerators by brackets.
	\begin{description}
        \item[Hint] An enumeration that contains all possible hints that a Robot can receive from a hint tile.
        \item[BoardResponse] An enumerator that contains all the possible responses that the board can give the controller when it makes a move request.
		\item[Board] The board as it was given in the informal specification.
		\item[Controller] The main controller as it was given in the informal specification.
        \item[Viewer] The viewer as it was given in the informal specification.
        \item[AbsoluteCoord] A data class that contains the x and y coordinate of an absolute coordinate.
		\item[BoardSnapshot] A data class that contains a snapshot of the board, i.e. a copy of all the tiles in the board.
		\item[Tile] Used to model the tiles that the Board consists of.
		\item[NormalTile] Tiles without a special meaning (specialization of the Tile class).
		\item[HomeTile] Tiles that are the \"home\" of each robot (specialization of the Tile class).
		\item[HintTile] Tiles that return a hint as to where the robot\'s home is (specialization of the Tile class).
		\item[ConveyorTile] Tiles that change the position and rotation of robots (specialization of the Tile class).
		\item[BrokenRobotTile] Tiles that are occupied by a defective robot (specialization of the Tile class).
		\item[Robot] This is used for both Robot A and Robot B in the informal specification.
		\item[Rule] An abstract class that is used to model the behaviour of Robot A and B in the Robot class. Any class that defines a rule inherits from this class.
		\item[RelativeCoord] A data class that contains the x and y coordinate of a relative coordinate.
		\item[Rotation] An enumeration that is used to model the rotation in robots and conveyors.
