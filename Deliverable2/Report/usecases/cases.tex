Next, the use cases for the game will be presented. These use cases are made to illustrate how the game works and what possible scenarios can be occur. In the use cases, a trigger for the use case and a pre-condition for the use case can be found. After that, the main scenario (usual case) of the use case will be presented and after that possible alternatives can be found.

The "Initialize viewer" use case illustrates the Initialize viewer state in the High Level Message Sequence Chart. This use case is used to illustrate how the viewer will be initialized.

Initialize viewer
- Pre-conditions: True
- Trigger: World messages the viewer
- Guarantee: Initialized viewer
- Main Scenarios
    (a) Viewer initializes
    (b) Viewer sends a message to the controller that he is the viewer
- Alternatives

The "Update viewer" use case illustrates the Update viewer state in the High Level Message Sequence Chart. Use case for updating the viewer after something on the board has changed.

Update viewer
- Pre-conditions: The game is initiated
- Trigger: Notify and new snapshot by the controller
- Guarantee: Update viewer
- Main Scenarios
    (a) Update view by the received snapshot
- Alternatives

The next use case illustrates the initialize state in the High Level Message Sequence Chart. In this use case, all of the different components (except for the viewer) will get initialized.

The "Robot move request" use case illustrates the Robot move request state in the High Level Message Sequence Chart. In this use case, the robot request the controller if it can make a move. The controller forwards this request to the board, which then decides. Note that the board here checks if the move is allowed. This also deals with the fact that, if a robot wants to move to its home tile and this is occupied, the robot still may move (and moves) to this tile.

Robot move Request

    is a empty tile.
- Trigger: A robot requests to move his position.
- Guarantee: The robot is moved to the indicated position.

    (a) The robot requests the controller if it may move
    (b) The controller sends the request to the board
    (c) The board checks the request
- Alternatives

- Alternatives

    (b) The board notifies the controller that the move request has been approved
    (c) The controller notifies the robot that his move request has been approved and that the robot has been moved to the requested position
    (d) The board makes a snapshot and sends this to the controller
    (e) The controller notifies the viewer that there are changes and sends the snapshot along with this
    (f) The board generates a hint for the robot
    (g) The board notifies the controller of the hint and the robot it needs to be send to
    (h) The controller sends the hint to the robot

- Pre-conditions: The game is initiated. And the indicated position
    is a conveyor tile, move request approved.
- Trigger: A robot requests to move his position to a conveyor
    belt tile.
- Guarantee: The robot is moved to the indicated position which
    is a conveyor belt tile.
- Main Scenarios
    (a) The robot is moved to the indicated position which is a conveyor
    (b) The board notifies the controller that the move request has been approved
    (c) The controller notifies the robot that his move request has been approved and that the robot has been moved to the requested position
    (d) The board calculates the new position (after movement over the conveyor tile)
    (e) The board makes a snapshot and sends this to the controller
    (f) The controller notifies the viewer that there are changes and sends the snapshot along

- Alternatives

The "Tiles exchange" use case illustrates both the Special exchange and the Ordinary exchange state in the High Level Message Sequence Chart. In the "normal" case, two tiles are swapped (no robots on it and they are normal tiles). In the special cases, either a robot is on a tile and needs to be notified that its position has changed and he has been rotated. Or a conveyor belt is switched and rotated (or a combination of both).

Tiles exchange

    (e.1) The controller notifies the robot that is has been moved
    (f.1) The board makes a snapshot and sends this to the controller

    (c.2) If a chosen tile is a conveyor tile, the rotation of the conveyor tile might change (can also be the same) (special exchange)
    (d.2) The board makes a snapshot and sends this to the controller
    (e.2) The controller notifies the viewer that there are changes and sends the snapshot along with this
    
The "Notify robots" use case illustrates the Notify robots state in the High Level Message Sequence Chart. This use case should deal with robots that have been moved by the board, due to movement of another robot (e.g. a robot blocks the end of the conveyor tile you are on, moves away and you will be pushed of the conveyor tile).
