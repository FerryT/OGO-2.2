This document describes a formal specification on the informal one given in "Informele Specificatie" by OGO 2.2 group 2 (see appendix~\ref{appendix:informal}).
It will formalize the core points of the given informal specification in order to remove all ambiguity.

The document follows the structure of the specification. First, the use cases will be discussed and a diagram of how they work together will be shown. Then, the message sequence charts will be given, along with a high level sequence chart that shows how they fit together. In the design section, the class diagram and class descriptions will be given. After that the state charts will be given to describe the changes in the state space of the model. In the last section we will give the resulting formal specification in Object-Z.

We will end the document with a conclusion.
