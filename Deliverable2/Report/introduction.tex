This document describes a formal specification on the informal one given in "Informele Specificatie" by OGO 2.2 group 2 (see appendix~\ref{appendix:informal}).
It will formalize the core points of the given informal specification in order to remove all ambiguity.

The major objective is to specify a game played by robots. These robots are in search of their home tiles on the board. When a robot finds his home tiles, he has won and the rest has lost. Though, many obstacles lie in the way of the robots, such as tiles filled with broken robots and conveyor tiles, which will move and rotate the robot. After being moved on such a conveyor tile, the orientation of the robot is lost. Also, a robot might be swapped to another tile by the board. 

In his quest to find his home tile, the robot has one object that might help him: the hint tile. This tile gives him a hint on in what direction his home tile lies. 

When one robot has won, the others are destroyed and fireworks are shown.

In the following document, a formal description will be given by the problem sketched here.
